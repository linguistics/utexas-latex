\chapter{Introduction}

Your ETD must be correct in spelling and punctuation and presented in a consistent, structured format. A single, legible font must be used throughout, the only exceptions being in tables, figures, graphs, appendices, and supplemental files. Headings may be bolded and no more than 2 points larger than the rest of the text. The font size should be sufficient for the average person to read the document on a computer monitor without difficulty (12-pt is recommended.) Accuracy and consistency in presentation and form make your ETD a usable research tool for other readers.


\section{A Section}

This is the first line of the first section of the first chapter, but not the first line of the first chapter, which belongs to no section.


\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:methodology}

This is the first line of Chapter~\ref{chap:methodology}, which I am calling ``Methodology.''
It consists of this paragraph, and later, Section~\ref{sec:method-issues}, which leads with a long-winded header, but quickly devolves into shallow platitudes.

\section{Methodological issues in the current literature: Inherent assumptions, impossible biases, and intellectual conundrums}
\label{sec:method-issues}

As you can see, there's a lot going on in this section.

\subsection{Conclusions}

Nearing the end, and thence the bibliography, we have our first citation: \citet{knuth:texbook} --- a \TeX\ reference, of course.
